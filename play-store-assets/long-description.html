CryptoTerminal is an open-source payment terminal app with which businesses can accept in-person cryptocurrency payments. The app currently supports the following payment options: Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Lightning Network (Bitcoin).

<b>Business-Focused</b>

In-person payments are often neglected by app designers in the cryptocurrency space. That's why we have decided to focus on businesses, by developing a payment solution that just works and doesn't bother you or your customers with implementation details. Future releases of this app will include full payment history exports with business accounting in mind, NFC payments, offline payment schemes, and more.

<b>Resolves Common Issues</b>

The app will do its best to smooth over and resolve many of the common gotcha's associated with cryptocurrency payments so that you can focus your attention on running your business. Future releases of this app will include catching low-fee transactions at the time of payment, rebroadcasting transactions that were dropped from the memory pool, and more.

<b>Security and Privacy</b>

You are in complete control of your funds. It is impossible for your funds to be compromised by the app because it does not have access to your private keys. We follow industry best practices to maintain our users' security and privacy, as well as provide explicit guidance wherever it makes sense to do so.
